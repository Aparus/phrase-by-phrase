# phrase-by-phrase

This is an tool for create and explore phrase-by-phrase navigation inside audio files, 
and add subtitles for media content in several languages. Best way is to use texts in couples: original lang wich are you learning, with translation into your native lang.
First is for audiobooks, for reading them phrase-by-phrase with translantions and captures. Next is for video content and youtube movies. 
We want to provide all medias with couples of texts, cause you can teach every foreign language by media content.
