<!--audio start="00:00:14.006" end="00:00:18.873"--><h1>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes<br/>
by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</h1><!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:00:19.126" end="00:00:23.497"--><h2>Adventure 9. The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb.</h2><!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:00:26.070" end="00:00:30.928"--><p>Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.
Sherlock Holmes,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:30.928" end="00:00:33.802"-->for solution during the years of our intimacy,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:00:33.802" end="00:00:38.256"-->there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his
notice<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:38.256" end="00:00:40.581"-->— that of Mr. Hatherley’s thumb,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:40.581" end="00:00:43.258"-->and that of Colonel
Warburton’s madness.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:43.258" end="00:00:49.084"-->Of these the latter may have afforded a
finer field for an acute and original observer,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:49.084" end="00:00:52.114"-->but the other was
so strange in its inception<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:52.114" end="00:00:57.678"-->and so dramatic in its details that
it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:57.696" end="00:01:02.816"-->even if it
gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of
reasoning<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:02.816" end="00:01:06.055"-->by which he achieved such remarkable results.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:06.055" end="00:01:10.875"-->The story
has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:10.875" end="00:01:13.160"-->but,
like all such narratives,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:13.160" end="00:01:19.260"-->its effect is much less striking when
set forth <i>en bloc</i> in a single half-column of print<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:19.260" end="00:01:23.387"-->than when the
facts slowly evolve before your own eyes,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:23.387" end="00:01:28.351"-->and the mystery clears
gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:28.351" end="00:01:31.041"-->which leads
on to the complete truth.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:31.041" end="00:01:34.889"-->At the time the circumstances made a
deep impression upon me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:34.907" end="00:01:39.173"-->and the lapse of two years has hardly
served to weaken the effect.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:01:39.422" end="00:01:42.661"--><p>It was in the summer of ’89,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:42.661" end="00:01:44.711"-->not long after my marriage,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:44.711" end="00:01:48.682"-->that the
events occurred which I am now about to summarise.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:48.682" end="00:01:54.677"-->I had returned
to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker
Street rooms,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:54.677" end="00:01:57.028"-->although I continually visited him<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:57.028" end="00:02:01.652"-->and occasionally
even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:01.652" end="00:02:04.251"-->so far as to come
and visit us.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:04.251" end="00:02:07.281"-->My practice had steadily increased,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:07.281" end="00:02:12.035"-->and as I
happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington
Station,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:12.035" end="00:02:15.536"-->I got a few patients from among the officials.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:15.536" end="00:02:20.225"-->One of
these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:20.225" end="00:02:23.673"-->was
never weary of advertising my virtues<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:23.673" end="00:02:29.485"-->and of endeavouring to send
me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:02:29.485" end="00:02:33.025"--><p>One morning, at a little before seven o’clock,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:33.025" end="00:02:36.003"-->I was awakened by
the maid tapping at the door<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:36.003" end="00:02:40.687"-->to announce that two men had come
from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:40.888" end="00:02:46.700"-->I
dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases
were seldom trivial,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:46.700" end="00:02:48.881"-->and hastened downstairs.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:48.881" end="00:02:55.786"-->As I descended, my
old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door
tightly behind him.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:02:55.882" end="00:02:57.841"--><p>“I’ve got him here,”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:57.841" end="00:03:00.858"-->he whispered, jerking his thumb over his
shoulder;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:00.858" end="00:03:02.564"-->“he’s all right.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:03:02.608" end="00:03:04.189"--><p>“What is it, then?”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:04.189" end="00:03:10.571"-->I asked, for his manner suggested that it was
some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:03:10.824" end="00:03:14.377"--><p>“It’s a new patient,” he whispered.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:14.377" end="00:03:16.832"-->“I thought I’d bring him
round myself;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:16.832" end="00:03:18.700"-->then he couldn’t slip away.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:18.700" end="00:03:21.690"-->There he is, all safe
and sound.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:21.690" end="00:03:23.702"-->I must go now, Doctor;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:23.702" end="00:03:26.740"-->I have my dooties, just the
same as you.”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:27.045" end="00:03:29.762"-->And off he went, this trusty tout,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:29.762" end="00:03:32.330"-->without even
giving me time to thank him.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:03:32.975" end="00:03:37.494"--><p>I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the
table.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:37.494" end="00:03:40.812"-->He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:40.812" end="00:03:44.861"-->with a
soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:44.861" end="00:03:47.983"-->Round one of
his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:47.983" end="00:03:51.209"-->which was mottled all
over with bloodstains.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:51.209" end="00:03:55.205"-->He was young, not more than
five-and-twenty, I should say,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:55.205" end="00:03:57.948"-->with a strong, masculine face;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:57.948" end="00:03:59.881"-->but
he was exceedingly pale<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:59.881" end="00:04:04.818"-->and gave me the impression of a man who
was suffering from some strong agitation,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:04.818" end="00:04:07.862"-->which it took all his
strength of mind to control.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:04:08.841" end="00:04:13.256"--><p>“I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,” said he,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:13.256" end="00:04:17.305"-->“but I
have had a very serious accident during the night.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:17.305" end="00:04:23.347"-->I came in by
train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I
might find a doctor,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:23.347" end="00:04:26.639"-->a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me
here.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:28.668"-->I gave the maid a card,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:28.668" end="00:04:31.576"-->but I see that she has left it upon
the side-table.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:04:32.090" end="00:04:34.703"--><p>I took it up and glanced at it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:34.703" end="00:04:36.740"-->“Mr. Victor Hatherley,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:36.740" end="00:04:38.255"-->hydraulic
engineer,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:38.255" end="00:04:41.764"-->16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:42.278" end="00:04:46.309"-->That was the name,
style, and abode of my morning visitor.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:46.562" end="00:04:49.488"-->“I regret that I have
kept you waiting,”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:49.488" end="00:04:52.636"-->said I, sitting down in my library-chair.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:52.636" end="00:04:55.679"-->“You
are fresh from a night journey, I understand,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:55.679" end="00:04:59.031"-->which is in itself
a monotonous occupation.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:04:59.571" end="00:05:03.855"--><p>“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:03.855" end="00:05:05.736"-->said he, and
laughed.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:05.736" end="00:05:09.080"-->He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:05:09.080" end="00:05:12.614"-->leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:12.763" end="00:05:16.172"-->All my medical
instincts rose up against that laugh.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:05:16.172" end="00:05:18.484"--><p>“Stop it!” I cried;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:18.484" end="00:05:20.660"-->“pull yourself together!”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:20.678" end="00:05:23.743"-->and I poured out
some water from a caraffe.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:05:24.048" end="00:05:26.020"--><p>It was useless, however.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:26.151" end="00:05:29.664"-->He was off in one of those hysterical
outbursts<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:29.664" end="00:05:34.087"-->which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis
is over and gone.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:34.340" end="00:05:37.396"-->Presently he came to himself once more,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:37.396" end="00:05:39.860"-->very
weary and pale-looking.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:05:40.270" end="00:05:44.841"--><p>“I have been making a fool of myself,” he gasped.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:05:44.841" end="00:05:47.440"--><p>“Not at all. Drink this.”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:47.440" end="00:05:49.909"-->I dashed some brandy into the water,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:05:49.909" end="00:05:53.919"-->and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:05:53.919" end="00:05:56.727"--><p>“That’s better!” said he.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:56.727" end="00:06:01.024"-->“And now, Doctor, perhaps you would
kindly attend to my thumb,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:01.024" end="00:06:04.454"-->or rather to the place where my thumb
used to be.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:06:04.916" end="00:06:08.234"--><p>He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:08.234" end="00:06:12.192"-->It gave even
my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:12.192" end="00:06:18.931"-->There were four
protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the
thumb should have been.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:18.931" end="00:06:22.719"-->It had been hacked or torn right out from
the roots.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:06:22.719" end="00:06:25.239"--><p>“Good heavens!” I cried,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:25.238" end="00:06:27.473"-->“this is a terrible injury.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:27.473" end="00:06:29.858"-->It must have
bled considerably.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:06:29.876" end="00:06:31.574"--><p>“Yes, it did.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:31.574" end="00:06:33.847"-->I fainted when it was done,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:33.847" end="00:06:37.225"-->and I think that I must
have been senseless for a long time.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:37.243" end="00:06:40.665"-->When I came to I found that
it was still bleeding, so I<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:40.665" end="00:06:46.229"-->tied one end of my handkerchief very
tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:06:46.229" end="00:06:49.320"--><p>“Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:06:49.442" end="00:06:52.472"--><p>“It is a question of hydraulics, you see,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:52.472" end="00:06:54.858"-->and came within my own
province.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:06:54.928" end="00:06:56.848"--><p>“This has been done,”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:56.848" end="00:06:59.369"-->said I, examining the wound,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:59.369" end="00:07:02.250"-->“by a very
heavy and sharp instrument.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:02.250" end="00:07:05.680"--><p>“A thing like a cleaver,” said he.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:05.725" end="00:07:07.979"--><p>“An accident, I presume?”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:08.180" end="00:07:10.348"--><p>“By no means.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:10.348" end="00:07:13.326"--><p>“What! a murderous attack?”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:13.326" end="00:07:15.860"--><p>“Very murderous indeed.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:15.860" end="00:07:18.089"--><p>“You horrify me.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:18.681" end="00:07:22.391"--><p>I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:22.391" end="00:07:27.236"-->and finally covered
it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:27.236" end="00:07:29.274"-->He lay back
without wincing,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:29.274" end="00:07:31.999"-->though he bit his lip from time to time.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:32.435" end="00:07:36.014"--><p>“How is that?” I asked when I had finished.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:36.014" end="00:07:41.147"--><p>“Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:07:41.147" end="00:07:44.525"-->I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:44.900" end="00:07:47.826"--><p>“Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:47.826" end="00:07:50.921"-->It is evidently
trying to your nerves.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:50.921" end="00:07:53.429"--><p>“Oh, no, not now.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:53.429" end="00:07:56.446"-->I shall have to tell my tale to the police;<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:07:56.446" end="00:08:01.592"-->but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing
evidence of this wound of mine,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:01.592" end="00:08:04.805"-->I should be surprised if they
believed my statement,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:04.805" end="00:08:07.679"-->for it is a very extraordinary one,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:07.679" end="00:08:11.214"-->and I
have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:11.232" end="00:08:13.269"-->and,
even if they believe me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:13.269" end="00:08:19.076"-->the clues which I can give them are so
vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:21.445"--><p>“Ha!” cried I,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:21.445" end="00:08:26.213"-->“if it is anything in the nature of a problem
which you desire to see solved,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:26.213" end="00:08:31.163"-->I should strongly recommend you
to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:31.163" end="00:08:33.906"-->before you go to the
official police.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:08:34.054" end="00:08:37.085"--><p>“Oh, I have heard of that fellow,”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:37.085" end="00:08:38.756"-->answered my visitor,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:38.756" end="00:08:41.978"-->“and I
should be very glad if he would take the matter up,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:41.978" end="00:08:45.826"-->though of
course I must use the official police as well.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:45.844" end="00:08:48.752"-->Would you give me
an introduction to him?”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:08:48.752" end="00:08:53.101"--><p>“I’ll do better. I’ll take you round to him myself.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:08:53.101" end="00:08:56.244"--><p>“I should be immensely obliged to you.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:08:56.392" end="00:08:58.900"--><p>“We’ll call a cab and go together.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:58.900" end="00:09:02.427"-->We shall just be in time to
have a little breakfast with him.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:02.427" end="00:09:04.760"-->Do you feel equal to it?”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:09:04.856" end="00:09:09.854"--><p>“Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:09:10.185" end="00:09:15.031"--><p>“Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an
instant.”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:15.030" end="00:09:16.694"-->I rushed upstairs,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:16.694" end="00:09:19.124"-->explained the matter shortly to my

new acquaintance to Baker Street.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:09:26.151" end="00:09:29.364"--><p>Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:29.364" end="00:09:32.590"-->lounging about his
sitting-room in his dressing-gown,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:32.590" end="00:09:37.501"-->reading the agony column of <i>The
Times</i> and smoking his before-breakfast pipe,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:37.501" end="00:09:42.681"-->which was composed
of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day
before,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:42.804" end="00:09:47.127"-->all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the
mantelpiece.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:47.127" end="00:09:50.562"-->He received us in his quietly genial fashion,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:09:50.562" end="00:09:53.109"-->ordered fresh rashers and eggs,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:53.109" end="00:09:55.311"-->and joined us in a hearty meal.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:09:55.486" end="00:09:59.717"-->When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the
sofa,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:59.717" end="00:10:02.017"-->placed a pillow beneath his head,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:02.017" end="00:10:05.499"-->and laid a glass of
brandy and water within his reach.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:10:06.223" end="00:10:12.440"--><p>“It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one,
Mr. Hatherley,” said he.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:12.440" end="00:10:16.706"-->“Pray, lie down there and make yourself
absolutely at home.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:16.750" end="00:10:18.539"-->Tell us what you can,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:18.539" end="00:10:23.432"-->but stop when you are
tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:10:23.516" end="00:10:26.572"--><p>“Thank you,” said my patient,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:26.572" end="00:10:30.686"-->“but I have felt another man since
the doctor bandaged me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:30.686" end="00:10:33.925"-->and I think that your breakfast has
completed the cure.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:33.925" end="00:10:42.010"-->I shall take up as little of your valuable
time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar
experiences.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:10:42.402" end="00:10:44.858"--><p>Holmes sat in his big armchair<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:44.858" end="00:10:49.925"-->with the weary, heavy-lidded
expression which veiled his keen and eager nature,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:49.925" end="00:10:52.172"-->while I sat
opposite to him,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:52.172" end="00:10:55.489"-->and we listened in silence to the strange story<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:10:55.489" end="00:10:58.345"-->which our visitor detailed to us.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:10:58.650" end="00:11:01.393"--><p>“You must know,” said he,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:01.393" end="00:11:04.045"-->“that I am an orphan and a bachelor,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:11:04.045" end="00:11:07.232"-->residing alone in lodgings in London.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:07.232" end="00:11:10.458"-->By profession I am a
hydraulic engineer,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:10.458" end="00:11:13.671"-->and I have had considerable experience of my
work<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:13.671" end="00:11:17.641"-->during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner &amp;
Matheson,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:17.641" end="00:11:20.280"-->the well-known firm, of Greenwich.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:20.280" end="00:11:21.925"-->Two years ago,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:11:21.925" end="00:11:23.754"-->having served my time,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:23.754" end="00:11:28.417"-->and having also come into a fair sum of 
money through my poor father’s death,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:28.417" end="00:11:31.826"-->I determined to start in
business for myself<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:31.826" end="00:11:35.491"-->and took professional chambers in Victoria
Street.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:11:35.587" end="00:11:41.935"--><p>“I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in
business a dreary experience.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:41.935" end="00:11:44.547"-->To me it has been exceptionally so.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:11:44.547" end="00:11:49.524"-->During two years I have had three consultations and one small
job,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:49.524" end="00:11:53.573"-->and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought
me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:53.573" end="00:11:58.092"-->My gross takings amount to £27 10<i>s</i>.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:58.092" end="00:11:59.411"-->Every day,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:59.411" end="00:12:02.546"-->from
nine in the morning until four in the afternoon,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:02.546" end="00:12:04.832"-->I waited in my
little den,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:04.832" end="00:12:07.614"-->until at last my heart began to sink,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:07.614" end="00:12:11.409"-->and I came to
believe that I should never have any practice at all.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:12:11.663" end="00:12:13.491"--><p>“Yesterday, however,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:13.491" end="00:12:17.383"-->just as I was thinking of leaving the
office, my clerk<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:17.383" end="00:12:19.917"-->entered to say there was a gentleman waiting<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:19.917" end="00:12:22.190"-->who
wished to see me upon business.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:22.190" end="00:12:24.175"-->He brought up a card, too,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:24.175" end="00:12:28.289"-->with
the name of ‘Colonel Lysander Stark’ engraved upon it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:28.289" end="00:12:31.712"-->Close at
his heels came the colonel himself,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:31.712" end="00:12:34.128"-->a man rather over the middle
size,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:34.128" end="00:12:36.283"-->but of an exceeding thinness.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:36.283" end="00:12:39.844"-->I do not think that I have
ever seen so thin a man.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:39.888" end="00:12:44.015"-->His whole face sharpened away into nose
and chin,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:44.015" end="00:12:49.579"-->and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over
his outstanding bones.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:49.579" end="00:12:53.445"-->Yet this emaciation seemed to be his
natural habit,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:53.445" end="00:12:55.365"-->and due to no disease,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:55.365" end="00:12:57.116"-->for his eye was bright,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:57.116" end="00:13:00.564"-->his
step brisk, and his bearing assured.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:00.564" end="00:13:03.307"-->He was plainly but neatly
dressed,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:03.307" end="00:13:05.135"-->and his age, I should judge,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:05.135" end="00:13:07.382"-->would be nearer forty than
thirty.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:13:08.079" end="00:13:10.456"--><p>‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:10.456" end="00:13:12.663"-->with something of a German accent.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:13:12.663" end="00:13:15.680"-->‘You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:15.680" end="00:13:19.638"-->as being a man
who is not only proficient in his profession<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:19.638" end="00:13:23.904"-->but is also discreet
and capable of preserving a secret.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:13:24.052" end="00:13:29.277"--><p>“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an
address.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:29.277" end="00:13:33.217"-->‘May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:13:34.053" end="00:13:37.788"--><p>‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:37.788" end="00:13:39.264"-->just
at this moment.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:39.264" end="00:13:43.535"-->I have it from the same source that you are both
an orphan and a bachelor<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:43.875" end="00:13:46.200"-->and are residing alone in London.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:13:46.557" end="00:13:49.418"--><p>‘That is quite correct,’ I answered;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:49.418" end="00:13:56.544"-->‘but you will excuse me if
I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional
qualifications.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:56.544" end="00:14:01.072"-->I understand that it was on a professional matter
that you wished to speak to me?’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:14:01.403" end="00:14:03.493"--><p>‘Undoubtedly so.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:03.493" end="00:14:07.424"-->But you will find that all I say is really to
the point.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:07.424" end="00:14:10.154"-->I have a professional commission for you,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:10.154" end="00:14:13.837"-->but absolute
secrecy is quite essential<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:13.837" end="00:14:16.685"-->— absolute secrecy, you understand,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:16.685" end="00:14:23.876"-->and
of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than
from one who lives in the bosom of his family.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:14:24.182" end="00:14:27.552"--><p>‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:27.552" end="00:14:31.243"-->‘you may absolutely
depend upon my doing so.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:14:31.679" end="00:14:34.239"--><p>“He looked very hard at me as I spoke,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:34.239" end="00:14:39.516"-->and it seemed to me that I
had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:14:39.516" end="00:14:41.854"--><p>‘Do you promise, then?’<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:41.854" end="00:14:43.656"-->said he at last.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:14:43.656" end="00:14:46.094"--><p>‘Yes, I promise.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:14:46.094" end="00:14:51.793"--><p>‘Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:51.793" end="00:14:54.236"-->No
reference to the matter at all,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:54.236" end="00:14:56.647"-->either in word or writing?’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:14:56.822" end="00:14:59.991"--><p>‘I have already given you my word.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:15:00.296" end="00:15:01.994"--><p>‘Very good.’<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:01.994" end="00:15:07.467"-->He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning
across the room he flung open the door.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:07.467" end="00:15:09.930"-->The passage outside was
empty.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:15:10.131" end="00:15:13.279"--><p>‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:13.279" end="00:15:17.824"-->‘I know that clerks are
sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:17.824" end="00:15:20.079"-->Now we can talk
in safety.’<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:20.123" end="00:15:23.245"-->He drew up his chair very close to mine<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:23.245" end="00:15:28.138"-->and began to
stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:15:28.208" end="00:15:30.428"--><p>“A feeling of repulsion,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:30.428" end="00:15:34.007"-->and of something akin to fear had begun
to rise within me<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:34.007" end="00:15:37.586"-->at the strange antics of this fleshless man.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:15:37.586" end="00:15:43.289"-->Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from
showing my impatience.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:15:43.385" end="00:15:47.565"--><p>‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said I;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:47.565" end="00:15:49.558"-->‘my time
is of value.’<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:54.913"-->Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the
words came to my lips.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:15:55.009" end="00:15:59.816"--><p>‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit you?’ he asked.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:16:00.469" end="00:16:02.201"--><p>‘Most admirably.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:16:02.349" end="00:16:06.907"--><p>‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be nearer the mark.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:06.907" end="00:16:09.377"-->I
simply want your opinion<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:09.377" end="00:16:12.969"-->about a hydraulic stamping machine which
has got out of gear.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:12.969" end="00:16:15.398"-->If you show us what is wrong<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:15.398" end="00:16:18.245"-->we shall soon
set it right ourselves.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:18.245" end="00:16:21.127"-->What do you think of such a commission as
that?’<!--/audio-->

would be no chance of a train back.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:08.719" end="00:17:11.287"-->I should be compelled to stop
the night.’<!--/audio-->

young and unknown man,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:30.748" end="00:17:35.189"-->a fee which would buy an opinion from the

place<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:38.497" end="00:18:40.508"-->— within ten miles of Reading.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:40.508" end="00:18:47.183"-->I was fortunate enough to
discover that there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my
fields.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:47.183" end="00:18:49.194"-->On examining it, however,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:49.194" end="00:18:53.008"-->I found that this deposit was a
comparatively small one,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:53.008" end="00:18:58.611"-->and that it formed a link between two
very much larger ones upon the right and left<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:58.611" end="00:19:00.165"-->— both of them,
however,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:00.165" end="00:19:02.373"-->in the grounds of my neighbours.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:02.621" end="00:19:05.285"-->These good people were
absolutely ignorant<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:05.285" end="00:19:09.734"-->that their land contained that which was
quite as valuable as a gold-mine.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:09.778" end="00:19:15.904"-->Naturally, it was to my
interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:19:15.904" end="00:19:20.828"-->but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:20.828" end="00:19:24.133"-->I
took a few of my friends into the secret, however,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:24.407" end="00:19:27.973"-->and they
suggested that we should quietly and secretly<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:27.973" end="00:19:30.128"-->work our own little
deposit<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:30.128" end="00:19:35.640"-->and that in this way we should earn the money which would
enable us to buy the neighbouring fields.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:35.640" end="00:19:38.539"-->This we have now been
doing for some time,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:38.539" end="00:19:41.648"-->and in order to help us in our operations<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:41.648" end="00:19:44.482"-->we
erected a hydraulic press.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:44.482" end="00:19:49.485"-->This press, as I have already
explained, has got out of order,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:49.485" end="00:19:52.449"-->and we wish your advice upon the
subject.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:52.449" end="00:19:56.015"-->We guard our secret very jealously, however,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:56.015" end="00:20:01.579"-->and if it
once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our
little house,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:01.579" end="00:20:03.839"-->it would soon rouse inquiry,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:03.857" end="00:20:06.574"-->and then, if the facts
came out,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:06.574" end="00:20:12.138"-->it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these
fields and carrying out our plans.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:12.138" end="00:20:14.980"-->That is why I have made you
promise me<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:14.980" end="00:20:19.186"-->that you will not tell a human being that you are
going to Eyford to-night.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:19.186" end="00:20:21.832"-->I hope that I make it all plain?’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:20:22.138" end="00:20:24.854"--><p>‘I quite follow you,’ said I.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:24.951" end="00:20:28.699"-->‘The only point which I could not
quite understand was<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:28.699" end="00:20:31.463"-->what use you could make of a hydraulic press<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:20:31.463" end="00:20:33.971"-->in excavating fuller’s-earth,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:33.971" end="00:20:35.669"-->which, as I understand,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:35.669" end="00:20:38.603"-->is dug out
like gravel from a pit.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:20:38.778" end="00:20:41.481"--><p>‘Ah!’ said he carelessly,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:41.481" end="00:20:43.649"-->‘we have our own process.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:43.648" end="00:20:46.066"-->We compress
the earth into bricks,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:46.066" end="00:20:49.627"-->so as to remove them without revealing
what they are.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:49.645" end="00:20:51.643"-->But that is a mere detail.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:51.643" end="00:20:56.123"-->I have taken you fully
into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:56.123" end="00:20:58.665"-->and I have shown you how I
trust you.’<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:58.970" end="00:21:00.773"-->He rose as he spoke.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:00.773" end="00:21:04.647"-->‘I shall expect you, then, at
Eyford at 11:15.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:21:05.214" end="00:21:07.651"--><p>‘I shall certainly be there.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:21:07.800" end="00:21:10.577"--><p>‘And not a word to a soul.’<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:10.778" end="00:21:14.853"-->He looked at me with a last long,
questioning gaze,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:14.853" end="00:21:18.797"-->and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank
grasp,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:18.797" end="00:21:20.347"-->he hurried from the room.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:21:20.443" end="00:21:24.518"--><p>“Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:24.518" end="00:21:27.901"-->I was very
much astonished, as you may both think,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:27.901" end="00:21:31.467"-->at this sudden commission
which had been intrusted to me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:31.537" end="00:21:34.593"-->On the one hand, of course, I was
glad,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:34.593" end="00:21:37.976"-->for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:21:37.976" end="00:21:40.889"-->had I set a price upon my own services,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:40.889" end="00:21:44.520"-->and it was possible that
this order might lead to other ones.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:44.520" end="00:21:46.126"-->On the other hand,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:46.126" end="00:21:48.686"-->the face
and manner of my patron<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:48.734" end="00:21:51.790"-->had made an unpleasant impression upon
me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:51.790" end="00:21:55.996"-->and I could not think that his explanation of the
fuller’s-earth was sufficient<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:55.996" end="00:21:59.339"-->to explain the necessity for my
coming at midnight,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:59.339" end="00:22:03.610"-->and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell
anyone of my errand.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:03.610" end="00:22:07.215"-->However, I threw all fears to the winds,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:07.215" end="00:22:08.730"-->ate
a hearty supper,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:08.730" end="00:22:10.337"-->drove to Paddington,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:10.337" end="00:22:15.700"-->and started off, having
obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:22:15.953" end="00:22:20.655"--><p>“At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:22:20.655" end="00:22:24.299"-->However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:24.299" end="00:22:28.505"-->and I
reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o’clock.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:28.505" end="00:22:31.339"-->I was the
only passenger who got out there,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:31.339" end="00:22:36.703"-->and there was no one upon the
platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:36.929" end="00:22:39.986"-->As I passed
out through the wicket gate, however,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:39.986" end="00:22:45.080"-->I found my acquaintance of
the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:45.080" end="00:22:49.181"-->Without a
word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:49.181" end="00:22:51.532"-->the door
of which was standing open.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:51.532" end="00:22:54.314"-->He drew up the windows on either
side,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:54.314" end="00:22:55.842"-->tapped on the wood-work,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:55.842" end="00:22:59.220"-->and away we went as fast as the
horse could go.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:22:59.473" end="00:23:02.621"--><p>“One horse?” interjected Holmes.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:23:02.621" end="00:23:04.484"--><p>“Yes, only one.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:23:04.685" end="00:23:06.861"--><p>“Did you observe the colour?”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:23:07.258" end="00:23:10.053"--><p>“Yes, I saw it by the side-lights<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:10.053" end="00:23:12.195"-->when I was stepping into the
carriage.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:12.195" end="00:23:13.875"-->It was a chestnut.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:23:13.945" end="00:23:16.513"--><p>“Tired-looking or fresh?”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:23:16.513" end="00:23:18.925"--><p>“Oh, fresh and glossy.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:23:19.039" end="00:23:22.827"--><p>“Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:22.827" end="00:23:26.196"-->Pray continue
your most interesting statement.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:23:26.815" end="00:23:30.916"--><p>“Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:30.916" end="00:23:35.840"-->Colonel
Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I
should think,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:35.840" end="00:23:37.721"-->from the rate that we seemed to go,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:37.721" end="00:23:39.806"-->and from the
time that we took,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:39.806" end="00:23:42.131"-->that it must have been nearer twelve.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:42.131" end="00:23:45.566"-->He sat
at my side in silence all the time,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:45.566" end="00:23:49.707"-->and I was aware, more than
once when I glanced in his direction,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:49.707" end="00:23:53.024"-->that he was looking at me
with great intensity.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:53.573" end="00:23:57.622"-->The country roads seem to be not very good
in that part of the world,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:57.622" end="00:24:00.352"-->for we lurched and jolted terribly.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:00.352" end="00:24:04.387"-->I
tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we
were,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:04.387" end="00:24:06.543"-->but they were made of frosted glass,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:06.543" end="00:24:11.793"-->and I could make out
nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:11.793" end="00:24:13.230"-->Now
and then<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:13.230" end="00:24:17.031"-->I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the
journey,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:17.031" end="00:24:20.165"-->but the colonel answered only in monosyllables,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:20.165" end="00:24:22.707"-->and the
conversation soon flagged.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:22.778" end="00:24:24.463"-->At last, however,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:24.463" end="00:24:29.517"-->the bumping of the
road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:24:29.517" end="00:24:32.012"-->and the carriage came to a stand.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:32.012" end="00:24:34.768"-->Colonel Lysander Stark sprang
out,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:34.768" end="00:24:37.223"-->and, as I followed after him,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:37.223" end="00:24:41.272"-->pulled me swiftly into a porch
which gaped in front of us.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:41.272" end="00:24:43.323"-->We stepped, as it were,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:43.323" end="00:24:46.392"-->right out of
the carriage and into the hall,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:46.392" end="00:24:51.055"-->so that I failed to catch the
most fleeting glance of the front of the house.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:51.055" end="00:24:55.992"-->The instant that
I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:24:55.992" end="00:25:00.781"-->and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage
drove away.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:25:01.347" end="00:25:04.260"--><p>“It was pitch dark inside the house,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:04.260" end="00:25:08.962"-->and the colonel fumbled
about looking for matches and muttering under his breath.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:25:08.962" end="00:25:12.698"-->Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:12.698" end="00:25:17.152"-->and a
long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:17.152" end="00:25:18.601"-->It grew
broader,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:18.601" end="00:25:21.383"-->and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:21.383" end="00:25:23.277"-->which she
held above her head,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:23.277" end="00:25:26.373"-->pushing her face forward and peering at us.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:25:26.373" end="00:25:28.554"-->I could see that she was pretty,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:28.554" end="00:25:32.368"-->and from the gloss with which
the light shone upon her dark dress<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:32.368" end="00:25:35.302"-->I knew that it was a rich
material.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:35.450" end="00:25:38.258"-->She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:38.258" end="00:25:40.884"-->in a tone as
though asking a question,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:40.884" end="00:25:44.502"-->and when my companion answered in a
gruff monosyllable<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:44.502" end="00:25:48.773"-->she gave such a start that the lamp nearly
fell from her hand.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:48.773" end="00:25:50.967"-->Colonel Stark went up to her,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:50.967" end="00:25:53.135"-->whispered
something in her ear,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:53.135" end="00:25:57.054"-->and then, pushing her back into the room
from whence she had come,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:57.280" end="00:26:00.502"-->he walked towards me again with the
lamp in his hand.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:26:01.442" end="00:26:05.491"--><p>‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a
few minutes,’<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:05.491" end="00:26:07.999"-->said he, throwing open another door.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:08.487" end="00:26:11.778"-->It was a
quiet, little, plainly furnished room,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:11.778" end="00:26:13.842"-->with a round table in the
centre,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:13.842" end="00:26:16.546"-->on which several German books were scattered.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:17.168" end="00:26:21.818"-->Colonel
Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the
door.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:22.149" end="00:26:25.741"-->‘I shall not keep you waiting an instant,’ said he,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:25.741" end="00:26:27.935"-->and
vanished into the darkness.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:26:27.935" end="00:26:30.652"--><p>“I glanced at the books upon the table,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:30.652" end="00:26:36.686"-->and in spite of my
ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises
on science,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:36.686" end="00:26:39.155"-->the others being volumes of poetry.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:39.155" end="00:26:41.767"-->Then I walked
across to the window,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:41.767" end="00:26:45.124"-->hoping that I might catch some glimpse of
the country-side,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:45.124" end="00:26:49.403"-->but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded
across it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:49.421" end="00:26:52.320"-->It was a wonderfully silent house.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:52.320" end="00:26:56.143"-->There was an old
clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:56.143" end="00:26:59.520"-->but otherwise
everything was deadly still.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:59.538" end="00:27:03.757"-->A vague feeling of uneasiness began
to steal over me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:03.757" end="00:27:05.886"-->Who were these German people,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:05.886" end="00:27:10.236"-->and what were
they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:10.236" end="00:27:12.652"-->And
where was the place?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:12.652" end="00:27:16.753"-->I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was
all I knew,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:16.753" end="00:27:21.463"-->but whether north, south, east, or west I had no
idea.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:21.507" end="00:27:23.806"-->For that matter, Reading,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:23.806" end="00:27:25.896"-->and possibly other large towns,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:27:25.896" end="00:27:27.489"-->were within that radius,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:27.489" end="00:27:30.781"-->so the place might not be so secluded,
after all.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:30.781" end="00:27:32.688"-->Yet it was quite certain,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:32.688" end="00:27:34.516"-->from the absolute stillness,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:27:34.516" end="00:27:36.510"-->that we were in the country.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:36.711" end="00:27:39.036"-->I paced up and down the room,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:27:39.036" end="00:27:42.353"-->humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:42.353" end="00:27:45.971"-->and feeling
that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:27:45.971" end="00:27:51.496"--><p>“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the
utter stillness,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:51.496" end="00:27:54.448"-->the door of my room swung slowly open.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:54.448" end="00:27:57.086"-->The woman
was standing in the aperture,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:57.086" end="00:27:59.385"-->the darkness of the hall behind
her,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:59.385" end="00:28:01.227"-->the yellow light from my lamp<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:01.227" end="00:28:04.479"-->beating upon her eager and
beautiful face.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:04.479" end="00:28:07.927"-->I could see at a glance that she was sick with
fear,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:07.927" end="00:28:11.101"-->and the sight sent a chill to my own heart.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:11.101" end="00:28:15.294"-->She held up one
shaking finger to warn me to be silent,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:15.294" end="00:28:19.120"-->and she shot a few
whispered words of broken English at me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:19.119" end="00:28:21.067"-->her eyes glancing back,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:28:21.067" end="00:28:23.235"-->like those of a frightened horse,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:23.235" end="00:28:25.437"-->into the gloom behind her.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:28:25.952" end="00:28:27.571"--><p>‘I would go,’<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:27.571" end="00:28:32.338"-->said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to
speak calmly;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:32.338" end="00:28:33.827"-->‘I would go.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:33.827" end="00:28:36.165"-->I should not stay here.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:36.165" end="00:28:38.681"-->There is no
good for you to do.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:41.507"--><p>‘But, madam,’ said I,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:41.507" end="00:28:44.041"-->‘I have not yet done what I came for.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:44.041" end="00:28:47.680"-->I
cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:28:48.169" end="00:28:52.322"--><p>‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:52.322" end="00:28:56.254"-->‘You can pass
through the door; no one hinders.’<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:56.272" end="00:28:59.876"-->And then, seeing that I smiled
and shook my head,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:59.876" end="00:29:04.221"-->she suddenly threw aside her constraint and
made a step forward,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:04.221" end="00:29:06.219"-->with her hands wrung together.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:06.219" end="00:29:09.406"-->‘For the love
of Heaven!’ she whispered,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:09.406" end="00:29:12.836"-->‘get away from here before it is too
late!’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:29:12.985" end="00:29:16.107"--><p>“But I am somewhat headstrong by nature,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:16.107" end="00:29:21.070"-->and the more ready to
engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:21.070" end="00:29:25.210"-->I
thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:25.210" end="00:29:28.528"-->and of
the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:28.528" end="00:29:30.996"-->Was it all to
go for nothing?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:30.996" end="00:29:34.967"-->Why should I slink away without having carried
out my commission,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:34.967" end="00:29:37.457"-->and without the payment which was my due?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:37.501" end="00:29:40.087"-->This
woman might, for all I knew,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:40.087" end="00:29:41.876"-->be a monomaniac.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:41.876" end="00:29:44.110"-->With a stout
bearing, therefore,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:44.110" end="00:29:47.663"-->though her manner had shaken me more than I
cared to confess,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:47.663" end="00:29:49.452"-->I still shook my head<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:49.452" end="00:29:53.070"-->and declared my intention
of remaining where I was.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:53.070" end="00:29:57.837"-->She was about to renew her entreaties
when a door slammed overhead,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:57.837" end="00:30:01.978"-->and the sound of several footsteps
was heard upon the stairs.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:01.978" end="00:30:04.015"-->She listened for an instant,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:04.015" end="00:30:06.784"-->threw up
her hands with a despairing gesture,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:06.784" end="00:30:10.898"-->and vanished as suddenly and
as noiselessly as she had come.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:30:11.726" end="00:30:15.031"--><p>“The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:15.031" end="00:30:20.765"-->and a short thick man
with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double
chin,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:20.765" end="00:30:24.299"-->who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:30:24.918" end="00:30:29.058"--><p>‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:29.058" end="00:30:34.022"-->‘By the
way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just
now.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:34.022" end="00:30:36.642"-->I fear that you have felt the draught.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:30:36.712" end="00:30:39.338"--><p>‘On the contrary,’ said I,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:39.338" end="00:30:44.249"-->‘I opened the door myself because I
felt the room to be a little close.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:30:44.975" end="00:30:47.927"--><p>“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:47.945" end="00:30:51.889"-->‘Perhaps we had
better proceed to business, then,’ said he.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:51.889" end="00:30:55.738"-->‘Mr. Ferguson and I
will take you up to see the machine.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:30:56.521" end="00:30:59.552"--><p>‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:30:59.569" end="00:31:02.556"--><p>‘Oh, no, it is in the house.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:31:02.600" end="00:31:06.531"--><p>‘What, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:31:06.531" end="00:31:10.175"--><p>‘No, no. This is only where we compress it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:10.175" end="00:31:12.043"-->But never mind that.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:31:12.043" end="00:31:15.460"-->All we wish you to do is to examine the machine<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:15.460" end="00:31:18.054"-->and to let us
know what is wrong with it.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:31:18.490" end="00:31:20.436"--><p>“We went upstairs together,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:20.436" end="00:31:22.539"-->the colonel first with the lamp,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:22.539" end="00:31:25.125"-->the
fat manager and I behind him.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:25.125" end="00:31:27.842"-->It was a labyrinth of an old house,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:31:27.842" end="00:31:29.971"-->with corridors, passages,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:29.971" end="00:31:32.126"-->narrow winding staircases,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:32.126" end="00:31:38.221"-->and little
low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the
generations who had crossed them.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:38.265" end="00:31:43.111"-->There were no carpets and no
signs of any furniture above the ground floor,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:43.111" end="00:31:46.102"-->while the plaster
was peeling off the walls,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:46.102" end="00:31:50.595"-->and the damp was breaking through in
green, unhealthy blotches.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:50.595" end="00:31:54.409"-->I tried to put on as unconcerned an
air as possible,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:54.409" end="00:31:57.230"-->but I had not forgotten the warnings of the
lady,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:57.230" end="00:31:59.280"-->even though I disregarded them,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:59.280" end="00:32:02.533"-->and I kept a keen eye upon
my two companions.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:02.533" end="00:32:06.242"-->Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent
man,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:06.242" end="00:32:11.475"-->but I could see from the little that he said that he was at
least a fellow-countryman.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:32:12.041" end="00:32:16.639"--><p>“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:16.639" end="00:32:18.141"-->which
he unlocked.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:18.141" end="00:32:20.583"-->Within was a small, square room,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:20.583" end="00:32:23.953"-->in which the three
of us could hardly get at one time.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:23.953" end="00:32:26.226"-->Ferguson remained outside,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:32:26.226" end="00:32:28.276"-->and the colonel ushered me in.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:32:29.334" end="00:32:31.424"--><p>‘We are now,’ said he,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:31.424" end="00:32:34.441"-->‘actually within the hydraulic press,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:34.441" end="00:32:39.622"-->and
it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were
to turn it on.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:39.640" end="00:32:44.564"-->The ceiling of this small chamber is really the
end of the descending piston,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:44.564" end="00:32:48.856"-->and it comes down with the force of
many tons upon this metal floor.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:49.318" end="00:32:54.190"-->There are small lateral columns
of water outside which receive the force,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:54.190" end="00:32:58.508"-->and which transmit and
multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:58.761" end="00:33:03.529"-->The machine
goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working
of it,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:03.529" end="00:33:06.232"-->and it has lost a little of its force.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:06.232" end="00:33:09.184"-->Perhaps you will
have the goodness to look it over<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:09.184" end="00:33:12.196"-->and to show us how we can set
it right.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:33:12.763" end="00:33:15.075"--><p>“I took the lamp from him,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:15.075" end="00:33:17.961"-->and I examined the machine very
thoroughly.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:17.961" end="00:33:20.926"-->It was indeed a gigantic one,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:20.926" end="00:33:24.440"-->and capable of
exercising enormous pressure.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:24.440" end="00:33:26.595"-->When I passed outside, however,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:26.595" end="00:33:29.259"-->and
pressed down the levers which controlled it,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:29.259" end="00:33:33.530"-->I knew at once by
the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:33.530" end="00:33:38.102"-->which allowed
a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:38.102" end="00:33:44.345"-->An
examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was
round the head of a driving-rod<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:44.345" end="00:33:49.152"-->had shrunk so as not quite to
fill the socket along which it worked.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:49.152" end="00:33:52.286"-->This was clearly the cause
of the loss of power,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:52.286" end="00:33:55.016"-->and I pointed it out to my companions,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:55.016" end="00:33:57.733"-->who
followed my remarks very carefully<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:57.733" end="00:34:02.861"-->and asked several practical
questions as to how they should proceed to set it right.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:03.088" end="00:34:05.204"-->When I
had made it clear to them,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:05.204" end="00:34:07.986"-->I returned to the main chamber of the
machine<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:07.986" end="00:34:12.200"-->and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:34:12.400" end="00:34:17.834"-->It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth
was the merest fabrication,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:17.834" end="00:34:24.743"-->for it would be absurd to suppose
that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a
purpose.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:24.743" end="00:34:26.833"-->The walls were of wood,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:26.833" end="00:34:30.229"-->but the floor consisted of a
large iron trough,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:30.229" end="00:34:32.162"-->and when I came to examine it<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:32.162" end="00:34:36.211"-->I could see a
crust of metallic deposit all over it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:36.211" end="00:34:40.861"-->I had stooped and was
scraping at this to see exactly what it was<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:40.861" end="00:34:43.839"-->when I heard a
muttered exclamation in German<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:43.839" end="00:34:47.739"-->and saw the cadaverous face of the
colonel looking down at me.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:34:47.783" end="00:34:50.840"--><p>‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:34:50.840" end="00:34:56.856"--><p>“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as
that which he had told me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:56.874" end="00:35:00.688"-->‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’
said I;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:00.688" end="00:35:04.841"-->‘I think that I should be better able to advise you as to
your machine<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:04.841" end="00:35:09.395"-->if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it
was used.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:35:09.543" end="00:35:14.964"--><p>“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of
my speech.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:14.964" end="00:35:16.923"-->His face set hard,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:16.923" end="00:35:20.632"-->and a baleful light sprang up in
his grey eyes.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:35:20.632" end="00:35:22.722"--><p>‘Very well,’ said he,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:22.722" end="00:35:25.543"-->‘you shall know all about the machine.’<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:25.543" end="00:35:27.437"-->He
took a step backward,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:27.437" end="00:35:30.964"-->slammed the little door, and turned the key
in the lock.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:30.964" end="00:35:34.921"-->I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it
was quite secure,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:34.921" end="00:35:38.147"-->and did not give in the least to my kicks and
shoves.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:38.147" end="00:35:42.309"-->‘Hullo!’ I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:35:42.562" end="00:35:44.887"--><p>“And then suddenly in the silence<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:44.887" end="00:35:47.904"-->I heard a sound which sent my
heart into my mouth.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:47.904" end="00:35:52.201"-->It was the clank of the levers and the swish
of the leaking cylinder.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:52.201" end="00:35:54.996"-->He had set the engine at work.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:54.996" end="00:35:58.366"-->The lamp
still stood upon the floor where I had placed it<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:58.366" end="00:36:00.195"-->when examining
the trough.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:00.195" end="00:36:06.164"-->By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming
down upon me, slowly, jerkily,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:06.164" end="00:36:08.776"-->but, as none knew better than
myself,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:08.776" end="00:36:13.360"-->with a force which must within a minute grind me to a
shapeless pulp.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:13.360" end="00:36:16.325"-->I threw myself, screaming, against the door,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:16.325" end="00:36:18.938"-->and
dragged with my nails at the lock.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:18.938" end="00:36:21.733"-->I implored the colonel to let
me out,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:21.733" end="00:36:25.742"-->but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my
cries.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:25.742" end="00:36:28.916"-->The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:28.916" end="00:36:33.030"-->and with
my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:33.030" end="00:36:38.647"-->Then it
flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend
very much upon the position<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:38.647" end="00:36:40.070"-->in which I met it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:40.070" end="00:36:42.174"-->If I lay on my
face<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:42.174" end="00:36:44.551"-->the weight would come upon my spine,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:44.551" end="00:36:47.894"-->and I shuddered to
think of that dreadful snap.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:47.893" end="00:36:50.388"-->Easier the other way, perhaps;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:50.388" end="00:36:56.822"-->and
yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black
shadow wavering down upon me?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:56.945" end="00:37:00.001"-->Already I was unable to stand
erect,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:00.001" end="00:37:04.502"-->when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope
back to my heart.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:37:04.782" end="00:37:10.646"--><p>“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the
walls were of wood.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:10.646" end="00:37:13.480"-->As I gave a last hurried glance around,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:13.480" end="00:37:17.125"-->I saw
a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:17.125" end="00:37:20.978"-->which
broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:20.978" end="00:37:27.392"-->For
an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door
which led away from death.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:27.392" end="00:37:30.552"-->The next instant I threw myself
through,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:30.552" end="00:37:33.426"-->and lay half-fainting upon the other side.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:33.496" end="00:37:36.160"-->The panel had
closed again behind me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:36.160" end="00:37:37.845"-->but the crash of the lamp,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:37.845" end="00:37:41.803"-->and a few
moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:41.803" end="00:37:45.416"-->told me
how narrow had been my escape.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:37:45.565" end="00:37:49.744"--><p>“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:49.744" end="00:37:54.041"-->and
I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:37:54.041" end="00:37:57.973"-->while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:37:57.973" end="00:38:00.559"-->while she held a candle in her right.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:00.559" end="00:38:05.583"-->It was the same good friend
whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:38:05.653" end="00:38:09.232"--><p>‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:09.232" end="00:38:11.225"-->‘They will be here in a
moment.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:11.225" end="00:38:13.445"-->They will see that you are not there.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:13.445" end="00:38:16.876"-->Oh, do not waste
the so-precious time, but come!’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:38:17.155" end="00:38:19.009"--><p>“This time, at least,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:19.009" end="00:38:21.478"-->I did not scorn her advice.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:21.478" end="00:38:23.254"-->I staggered to
my feet<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:23.254" end="00:38:27.459"-->and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding
stair.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:27.459" end="00:38:30.359"-->The latter led to another broad passage,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:30.359" end="00:38:33.899"-->and just as we
reached it we heard the sound of running feet<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:33.899" end="00:38:35.937"-->and the shouting of
two voices,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:35.937" end="00:38:39.150"-->one answering the other from the floor on which  we
were<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:39.150" end="00:38:40.952"-->and from the one beneath.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:40.952" end="00:38:45.680"-->My guide stopped and looked about
her like one  who is at her wit’s end.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:49.246"-->Then she threw open a door
which led into a bedroom,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:49.246" end="00:38:52.467"-->through the window of which the moon
was shining brightly.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:38:52.485" end="00:38:55.503"--><p>‘It is your only chance,’ said she.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:55.503" end="00:38:58.750"-->‘It is high, but it may be
that you can jump it.’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:38:58.872" end="00:39:00.440"--><p>“As she spoke<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:00.440" end="00:39:03.836"-->a light sprang into view at the further end of the
passage,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:03.836" end="00:39:07.258"-->and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:39:07.258" end="00:39:10.014"-->rushing forward with a lantern in one hand<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:10.014" end="00:39:13.209"-->and a weapon like a
butcher’s cleaver in the other.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:13.227" end="00:39:15.382"-->I rushed across the bedroom,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:39:15.382" end="00:39:18.177"-->flung open the window, and looked out.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:18.177" end="00:39:22.618"-->How quiet and sweet and
wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:22.618" end="00:39:25.525"-->and it could not be
more than thirty feet down.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:25.622" end="00:39:27.790"-->I clambered out upon the sill,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:27.790" end="00:39:30.507"-->but I
hesitated to jump until I should have heard<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:30.507" end="00:39:33.942"-->what passed between
my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:33.942" end="00:39:35.914"-->If she were ill-used,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:39:35.914" end="00:39:40.054"-->then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:39:40.054" end="00:39:42.601"-->The thought had hardly flashed through my mind<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:42.601" end="00:39:44.273"-->before he was at
the door,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:44.273" end="00:39:46.128"-->pushing his way past her;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:46.128" end="00:39:49.850"-->but she threw her arms round
him and tried to hold him back.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:39:49.850" end="00:39:53.233"--><p>‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:53.233" end="00:39:56.015"-->‘remember your promise
after the last time.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:56.015" end="00:39:58.209"-->You said it should not be again.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:58.209" end="00:39:59.868"-->He will be
silent!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:59.868" end="00:40:02.071"-->Oh, he will be silent!’<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:40:02.115" end="00:40:04.936"--><p>‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:04.936" end="00:40:07.091"-->struggling to break away from
her.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:07.091" end="00:40:09.325"-->‘You will be the ruin of us.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:09.325" end="00:40:10.970"-->He has seen too much.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:10.970" end="00:40:12.912"-->Let me
pass, I say!’<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:13.008" end="00:40:15.111"-->He dashed her to one side,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:15.111" end="00:40:18.729"-->and, rushing to the
window, cut at me with his heavy weapon.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:18.729" end="00:40:20.583"-->I had let myself go,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:20.583" end="00:40:24.358"-->and
was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:24.358" end="00:40:26.670"-->I was
conscious of a dull pain,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:26.670" end="00:40:28.133"-->my grip loosened,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:28.133" end="00:40:30.570"-->and I fell into the
garden below.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:40:31.712" end="00:40:34.428"--><p>“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:34.585" end="00:40:38.869"-->so I picked myself up and
rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:38.869" end="00:40:42.605"-->for I
understood that I was far from being out of danger yet.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:42.605" end="00:40:45.112"-->Suddenly,
however, as I ran,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:45.112" end="00:40:48.273"-->a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:40:48.273" end="00:40:50.376"-->I glanced down at my hand,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:50.376" end="00:40:52.374"-->which was throbbing painfully,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:52.374" end="00:40:56.058"-->and
then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:56.058" end="00:40:58.652"-->and
that the blood was pouring from my wound.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:58.801" end="00:41:01.778"-->I endeavoured to tie my
handkerchief round it,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:01.778" end="00:41:04.430"-->but there came a sudden buzzing in my
ears,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:04.430" end="00:41:08.879"-->and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the
rose-bushes.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:41:08.975" end="00:41:12.959"--><p>“How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:12.959" end="00:41:16.485"-->It must have been
a very long time, for the moon had sunk,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:16.485" end="00:41:19.842"-->and a bright morning was
breaking when I came to myself.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:19.842" end="00:41:22.520"-->My clothes were all sodden with
dew,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:22.520" end="00:41:26.603"-->and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded
thumb.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:26.603" end="00:41:29.390"-->The smarting of it recalled in an instant<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:29.390" end="00:41:31.858"-->all the
particulars of my night’s adventure,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:31.858" end="00:41:34.118"-->and I sprang to my feet with
the feeling<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:34.118" end="00:41:37.318"-->that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:37.318" end="00:41:39.369"-->But
to my astonishment,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:39.369" end="00:41:41.119"-->when I came to look round me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:41.119" end="00:41:44.384"-->neither house
nor garden were to be seen.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:44.384" end="00:41:48.459"-->I had been lying in an angle of the
hedge close by the highroad,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:48.459" end="00:41:51.698"-->and just a little lower down was a
long building,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:51.698" end="00:41:54.063"-->which proved, upon my approaching it,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:54.063" end="00:41:58.799"-->to be the
very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:58.947" end="00:42:02.134"-->Were
it not for the ugly wound upon my hand,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:02.134" end="00:42:07.054"-->all that had passed
during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:42:07.424" end="00:42:10.454"--><p>“Half dazed, I went into the station<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:10.454" end="00:42:12.570"-->and asked about the morning
train.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:12.588" end="00:42:15.710"-->There would be one to Reading in less than an hour.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:15.710" end="00:42:20.773"-->The
same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I
arrived.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:20.773" end="00:42:25.527"-->I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel
Lysander Stark.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:25.527" end="00:42:27.886"-->The name was strange to him.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:28.035" end="00:42:32.188"-->Had he observed a
carriage the night before waiting for me?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:32.188" end="00:42:34.174"-->No, he had not.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:34.174" end="00:42:37.178"-->Was
there a police-station anywhere near?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:37.178" end="00:42:40.190"-->There was one about three
miles off.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:42:40.469" end="00:42:43.055"--><p>“It was too far for me to go,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:43.055" end="00:42:45.432"-->weak and ill as I was.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:45.432" end="00:42:50.892"-->I determined
to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the
police.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:50.892" end="00:42:53.413"-->It was a little past six when I arrived,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:53.413" end="00:42:56.443"-->so I went first
to have my wound dressed,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:56.443" end="00:42:59.943"-->and then the doctor was kind enough to
bring me along here.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:59.943" end="00:43:02.412"-->I put the case into your hands<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:02.412" end="00:43:05.215"-->and shall do
exactly what you advise.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:43:05.991" end="00:43:12.325"--><p>We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to
this extraordinary narrative.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:12.325" end="00:43:17.511"-->Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down
from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:17.511" end="00:43:19.713"-->in which he
placed his cuttings.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:43:19.731" end="00:43:24.041"--><p>“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:24.041" end="00:43:27.333"-->“It
appeared in all the papers about a year ago.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:27.333" end="00:43:28.926"-->Listen to this:<!--/audio-->

twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:36.593" end="00:43:39.519"-->Left his lodgings at ten
o’clock at night,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:39.519" end="00:43:41.765"-->and has not been heard of since.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:41.765" end="00:43:44.861"-->Was

the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:43:51.888" end="00:43:55.114"--><p>“Good heavens!” cried my patient.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:55.114" end="00:43:58.027"-->“Then that explains what the
girl said.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:43:58.027" end="00:43:59.581"--><p>“Undoubtedly.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:59.581" end="00:44:03.538"-->It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and
desperate man,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:44:03.538" end="00:44:08.345"-->who was absolutely determined that nothing should
stand in the way of his little game,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:44:08.345" end="00:44:12.995"-->like those out-and-out
pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:44:12.995" end="00:44:16.338"-->Well,
every moment now is precious,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:44:16.338" end="00:44:18.311"-->so if you feel equal to it<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:44:18.311" end="00:44:23.204"-->we shall
go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for
Eyford.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:44:23.692" end="00:44:28.237"--><p>Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train
together,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:44:28.237" end="00:44:31.385"-->bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:44:31.385" end="00:44:34.794"-->There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:44:34.794" end="00:44:37.720"-->Inspector
Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:44:37.720" end="00:44:40.515"-->a plain-clothes man, and myself.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:44:40.515" end="00:44:45.021"-->Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the
seat<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:44:45.021" end="00:44:49.783"-->and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford
for its centre.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:44:50.272" end="00:44:52.649"--><p>“There you are,” said he.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:44:52.649" end="00:44:56.867"-->“That circle is drawn at a radius of
ten miles from the village.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:44:56.867" end="00:45:00.237"-->The place we want must be somewhere
near that line.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:45:00.237" end="00:45:02.910"-->You said ten miles, I think, sir.”<!--/audio-->

were unconscious?”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:45:10.934" end="00:45:13.011"--><p>“They must have done so.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:45:13.011" end="00:45:15.597"-->I have a confused memory, too,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:45:15.597" end="00:45:18.636"-->of having
been lifted and conveyed somewhere.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:45:19.267" end="00:45:22.272"--><p>“What I cannot understand,” said I,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:45:22.272" end="00:45:26.974"-->“is why they should have
spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:45:26.974" end="00:45:30.769"-->Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman’s entreaties.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:45:30.814" end="00:45:33.400"--><p>“I hardly think that likely.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:45:33.400" end="00:45:37.065"-->I never saw a more inexorable face
in my life.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:45:37.187" end="00:45:40.374"--><p>“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:45:40.374" end="00:45:41.863"-->said Bradstreet.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:45:41.863" end="00:45:44.201"-->“Well, I
have drawn my circle,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:45:44.201" end="00:45:50.270"-->and I only wish I knew at what point upon
it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:45:50.445" end="00:45:53.514"--><p>“I think I could lay my finger on it,”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:45:53.514" end="00:45:55.507"-->said Holmes quietly.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:45:55.507" end="00:45:58.603"--><p>“Really, now!” cried the inspector,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:45:58.603" end="00:46:01.254"-->“you have formed your
opinion!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:46:01.254" end="00:46:04.337"-->Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:46:04.337" end="00:46:06.262"-->I say it is
south,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:46:06.262" end="00:46:08.621"-->for the country is more deserted there.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:46:09.214" end="00:46:13.140"--><p>“And I say east,” said my patient.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:46:13.367" end="00:46:15.770"--><p>“I am for west,”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:46:15.770" end="00:46:17.795"-->remarked the plain-clothes man.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:46:17.795" end="00:46:21.199"-->“There are
several quiet little villages up there.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:46:21.739" end="00:46:24.822"--><p>“And I am for north,” said I,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:46:24.822" end="00:46:26.951"-->“because there are no hills there,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:46:26.951" end="00:46:30.699"-->and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up
any.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:46:30.699" end="00:46:33.925"--><p>“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:46:33.925" end="00:46:37.974"-->“it’s a very pretty
diversity of opinion.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:46:37.974" end="00:46:40.273"-->We have boxed the compass among us.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:46:40.273" end="00:46:42.737"-->Who do
you give your casting vote to?”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:46:43.199" end="00:46:45.166"--><p>“You are all wrong.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:46:45.184" end="00:46:47.992"--><p>“But we can’t all be.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:46:47.992" end="00:46:49.769"--><p>“Oh, yes, you can.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:46:49.769" end="00:46:51.819"-->This is my point.”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:46:51.819" end="00:46:54.849"-->He placed his finger in the
centre of the circle.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:46:54.849" end="00:46:57.392"-->“This is where we shall find them.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:46:57.592" end="00:47:01.676"--><p>“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:47:01.772" end="00:47:05.586"--><p>“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:47:05.586" end="00:47:09.726"-->You say yourself that the
horse was fresh and glossy when you got in.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:47:09.726" end="00:47:14.123"-->How could it be that
if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:47:14.533" end="00:47:18.020"--><p>“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:47:18.020" end="00:47:20.476"-->observed Bradstreet
thoughtfully.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:47:20.476" end="00:47:24.768"-->“Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature
of this gang.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:47:24.768" end="00:47:27.607"--><p>“None at all,” said Holmes.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:47:27.607" end="00:47:30.141"-->“They are coiners on a large scale,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:47:30.141" end="00:47:34.903"-->and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the
place of silver.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:47:35.339" end="00:47:40.067"--><p>“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,”<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:47:40.067" end="00:47:41.583"-->said the inspector.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:47:41.583" end="00:47:45.057"-->“They have been turning out half-crowns by
the thousand.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:47:45.056" end="00:47:48.531"-->We even traced them as far as Reading, but could
get no farther,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:47:48.531" end="00:47:53.756"-->for they had covered their traces in a way that
showed that they were very old hands.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:47:53.756" end="00:47:58.988"-->But now, thanks to this
lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:47:59.215" end="00:48:01.827"--><p>But the inspector was mistaken,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:48:01.827" end="00:48:06.556"-->for those criminals were not
destined to fall into the hands of justice.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:48:06.556" end="00:48:09.063"-->As we rolled into
Eyford Station<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:48:09.063" end="00:48:15.411"-->we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed
up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:48:15.411" end="00:48:19.312"-->and
hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:48:19.382" end="00:48:21.485"--><p>“A house on fire?”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:48:21.485" end="00:48:25.725"-->asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off
again on its way.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:48:25.808" end="00:48:29.047"--><p>“Yes, sir!” said the station-master.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:48:29.047" end="00:48:31.197"--><p>“When did it break out?”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:48:31.241" end="00:48:33.854"--><p>“I hear that it was during the night, sir,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:48:33.854" end="00:48:37.759"-->but it has got worse,
and the whole place is in a blaze.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:48:37.759" end="00:48:39.679"--><p>“Whose house is it?”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:48:39.679" end="00:48:41.725"--><p>“Dr. Becher’s.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:48:41.769" end="00:48:44.459"--><p>“Tell me,” broke in the engineer,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:48:44.459" end="00:48:49.449"-->“is Dr. Becher a German, very
thin, with a long, sharp nose?”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:48:49.449" end="00:48:52.174"--><p>The station-master laughed heartily.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:48:52.244" end="00:48:56.162"-->“No, sir, Dr. Becher is an
Englishman,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:48:56.162" end="00:48:59.649"-->and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a
better-lined waistcoat.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:48:59.649" end="00:49:02.014"-->But he has a gentleman staying with him,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:49:02.014" end="00:49:03.999"-->a patient, as I understand,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:49:03.999" end="00:49:05.344"-->who is a foreigner,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:49:05.344" end="00:49:09.663"-->and he looks as
if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:49:09.942" end="00:49:16.141"--><p>The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all
hastening in the direction of the fire.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:49:16.263" end="00:49:18.301"-->The road topped a low
hill,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:49:18.301" end="00:49:22.180"-->and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in
front of us,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:49:22.180" end="00:49:24.910"-->spouting fire at every chink and window,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:49:24.910" end="00:49:30.769"-->while in
the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to
keep the flames under.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:49:30.787" end="00:49:32.263"--><p>“That’s it!”<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:49:32.263" end="00:49:34.797"-->cried Hatherley, in intense excitement.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:49:34.797" end="00:49:36.835"-->“There is
the gravel-drive,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:49:36.835" end="00:49:39.369"-->and there are the rose-bushes where I lay.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:49:39.369" end="00:49:42.538"-->That
second window is the one that I jumped from.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:49:42.817" end="00:49:45.494"--><p>“Well, at least,” said Holmes,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:49:45.494" end="00:49:47.832"-->“you have had your revenge upon
them.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:49:47.832" end="00:49:51.646"-->There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:49:51.646" end="00:49:53.449"-->when it was crushed in the press,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:49:53.449" end="00:49:55.695"-->set fire to the wooden walls,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:49:55.695" end="00:50:00.645"-->though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to
observe it at the time.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:50:00.645" end="00:50:04.877"-->Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for
your friends of last night,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:50:04.877" end="00:50:08.856"-->though I very much fear that they are
a good hundred miles off by now.”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:50:09.880" end="00:50:12.936"--><p>And Holmes’ fears came to be realised,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:50:12.936" end="00:50:18.539"-->for from that day to this
no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:50:18.539" end="00:50:20.198"-->the
sinister German,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:50:20.198" end="00:50:22.061"-->or the morose Englishman.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:50:22.314" end="00:50:26.755"-->Early that morning a
peasant had met a cart containing several people<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:50:26.755" end="00:50:31.352"-->and some very
bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:50:31.352" end="00:50:34.827"-->but
there all traces of the fugitives disappeared,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:50:34.827" end="00:50:40.756"-->and even Holmes’
ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their
whereabouts.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:50:41.383" end="00:50:46.294"--><p>The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements
which they had found within,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:50:46.294" end="00:50:52.755"-->and still more so by discovering a
newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:50:53.217" end="00:50:57.553"-->About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:50:57.553" end="00:50:59.538"-->and
they subdued the flames,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:50:59.538" end="00:51:01.916"-->but not before the roof had fallen in,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:51:01.916" end="00:51:06.017"-->and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:06.017" end="00:51:09.125"-->save
some twisted cylinders and iron piping,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:09.125" end="00:51:11.581"-->not a trace remained of
the machinery<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:11.581" end="00:51:15.377"-->which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so
dearly.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:15.395" end="00:51:20.489"-->Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored
in an out-house,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:20.489" end="00:51:22.500"-->but no coins were to be found,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:22.500" end="00:51:26.001"-->which may have
explained the presence of those bulky boxes<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:26.001" end="00:51:28.334"-->which have been
already referred to.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:51:28.743" end="00:51:35.274"--><p>How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to
the spot where he recovered his senses<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:35.274" end="00:51:37.782"-->might have remained
forever a mystery<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:37.782" end="00:51:39.898"-->were it not for the soft mould,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:39.898" end="00:51:42.283"-->which told us a
very plain tale.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:42.283" end="00:51:45.770"-->He had evidently been carried down by two
persons,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:45.770" end="00:51:48.570"-->one of whom had remarkably small feet<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:48.570" end="00:51:51.770"-->and the other
unusually large ones.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:51.770" end="00:51:56.211"-->On the whole, it was most probable that the
silent Englishman,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:56.211" end="00:51:59.698"-->being less bold or less murderous than his
companion,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:51:59.698" end="00:52:03.094"-->had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:52:03.094" end="00:52:04.827"-->out
of the way of danger.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:52:05.472" end="00:52:08.502"--><p>“Well,” said our engineer ruefully<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:52:08.502" end="00:52:11.645"-->as we took our seats to return
once more to London,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:52:11.741" end="00:52:14.667"-->“it has been a pretty business for me!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:52:14.667" end="00:52:18.010"-->I
have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:52:18.010" end="00:52:19.821"-->and what
have I gained?”<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:52:19.839" end="00:52:23.418"--><p>“Experience,” said Holmes, laughing.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:52:23.418" end="00:52:26.383"-->“Indirectly it may be of
value, you know;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:52:26.383" end="00:52:30.418"-->you have only to put it into words to gain the
reputation of being<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:52:30.418" end="00:52:34.711"-->excellent company for the remainder of your
existence.”<!--/audio-->
